        <h1>Assignment 2.2 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>

        <p class="intro">I was born in Napa Valley, CA, grew up in Portal, AZ, and am currently living in Virginia Beach VA. I moved to VA due to my military obligations and have enjoyed it for the most part. <span class="sentence">However, I plan to eventually move to the country again soon where the cost of living is much more manageable.</span></p>

        <p>I met my wonderful wife whilst in the Navy and we both are military vets at this point. Together we have a 10-year-old boy who we both completely adore. That boy has aged me 10 years it seems trying to keep up with him, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything else in the world.</p>

        <p>My primary hobby and pastime is tinkering and playing with my computer. I've built all the computers we use in the house and am pretty passionate about them. I also am a lifetime gamer and thankfully have a wife who also games regularly with me. I additionally enjoy reading a good novel now and then.</p>

        <p>I have been thoroughly enjoying attending Bellevue University so far. The classes I've taken have been challenging yet rewarding and have enriched my learning experience immensely. I can’t wait to further explore and engage with even more of what is in store for me here.</p>
